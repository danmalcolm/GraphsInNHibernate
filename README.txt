MAPPING GRAPH STRUCTURES IN NHIBERNATE

____________
INTRODUCTION

Looking at options for mapping graph structures in NHibernate.

Will include:

Model
Various mapping options
Efficient graph retrieval etc

Just playin' around really. I'm sort of expecting to find that it can't be done that well, which can justify looking further into graph databases.
